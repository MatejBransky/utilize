# @utilize/react-router

Temporary fork of the [`react-router` v6](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/dev).

It's a **temporary** replacement for react-router v6 until these issues will be solved:

- [add location prop to Routes and RouteOptions to useRoutes](https://github.com/MatejBransky/utilize/commit/5f1c25909ef9b3c0a49e64f22f8488b81af01479#diff-d59f1a00dff1823e6f16ddf621c708682b1acc37566b17d047bbe4263a580058) (https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/pull/7571)
- add generics support to `useParams` and `useLocation` (https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/pull/7326)

_It doesn't publish different versions for prod/dev environment._
